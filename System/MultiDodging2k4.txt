Multi Dodging 2k4

Description
-----------
Normally UT2004 only allows you to dodge or walldodge once during a jump and
also add one double-jump somewhere in the whole move. Also at the end of a jump
you have to wait a bit before you can dodge again.

Multi Dodging changes these rules so you can:
- walldodge whenever you are near a wall even if you already (wall)dodged
- always add a double-jump after a dodge or walldodge
- dodge right after landing without any delay

Additionally Multi Dodging can gather movement stats like speed and distances
and display them on the HUD. Configuring key binds for the stats display is
only possible if Multi Dodging was installed locally, because the required
metadata cannot be downloaded from servers.


Installation
------------
Just unzip MultiDodging2k4v4.u, .ucl and .int to your UT2004\System directory
and you're ready to play.

To enable it on a server, I recommend adding the line
ServerPackages=MultiDodging2k4v4
to the [Engine.GameEngine] section of the server's UT2004.ini file.


How to use
----------
Multi Dodging can be enabled as a mutator (MultiDodging2k4v4.MutMultiDodging)
via the startup command line, voting configuration or manually via the mutators
page on webadmin. Note that the mutator is not "white-listed", i.e. the server
will no longer show up in the browser while the "Standard Servers Only"
checkbox is enabled.

To keep the server's white-listing status (assuming you don't use any other
non-standard settings or mutators), you can instead run Multi Dodging as a
server actor by adding the line
ServerActors=MultiDodging2k4v4.MultiDodgingRules
to the [Engine.GameEngine] section of the server's UT2004.ini file. This has
several drawbacks, though. For example, the entire movement stats feature set
is inaccessible. Also you can't disable or configure Multi Dodging via the
webadmin interface. To change the configuration, either add the mutator to make
the options show up in webadmin, or edit UT2004.ini directly.

Below is the default configuration. Note that bGatherJumpStats has no effects
unless the mutator is used.

[MultiDodging2k4v4.MutMultiDodging]
MaxDodgesPerJump=-1
bAlwaysAllowDodgeDoubleJump=True
bEnableBoostDodge=False
bFastDodging=True
bGatherJumpStats=False

You can use the standard UT2004 keybind configuration to select keys for
resetting movement stats and for toggling the stats display.
